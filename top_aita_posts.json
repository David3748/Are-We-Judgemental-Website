I actually left the bedroom and took a blowup mattress downstairs, where it is cooler.\n\nBut I am lying here on this crappy mattress, thinking longingly of the air con we just bought, and I am wondering if I would be the asshole if I asked him to sleep downstairs instead. I get to use the fan and aircon and he gets to sleep away from the noise (on a bad mattress, I'll admit).",
