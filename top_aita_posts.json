I didn't know who made them... and noone told me the olives still had pits in them. \n\nLuckily, I was chewing very slowly so my teeth didn't get hurt or anything. However, a few days later the guy who made them told me they were his doing, so I called him out for putting olives with pits in them. \n\nHe got really offended, and said he told people about the olives, and that the person who handed me the empenadas should have warned me. I feel like it's pretty common sense NOT to use olives with pits in them, unless you're eating olives on their own as a snack. \n\nThoughts?",
