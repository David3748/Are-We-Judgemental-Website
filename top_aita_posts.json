Asked the kids what they wanted. Albert wanted an official cap from his favourite football club, Nathan some chocolate not available in our country and Sam a couple of museum guidebooks. I managed to get all the items.\n\nMy brother was not pleased, though. He said it could upset Sam to see the others get more special gifts and I could have gotten him something extra not on the list.\n\nUPDATE : So I talked to my brother again. He said he was upset about something else and took it out on me when I visited. We’re good now.",
