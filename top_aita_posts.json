        "body_summary": "i just found out that my birth mother, who I have never met, left me her whole estate ($180k)! I was adopted at birth by a wonderful family with two other adopted kids.\n\nMy siblings are now saying that it isn't fair I got everything when they also \"deserve\" it being adopted as well. They want to split it three ways! My parents are staying neutral which I can tell is uncomfortable.\n\nThe thing is, this was MY birth mother. She chose to find me and leave me this money. My siblings have their own birth families they could easily have a connection to someday. For me, this feels like my one connection to where I came from.\n\nNow family dinners are awkward because my siblings barely talk to me. Am I being selfish keeping money that was legally left to me??",
