I(26) knew he’s quite busy but didn’t think he would forget.\n\nOn Mom’s birthday, my brother and I got her one present each. Her favorite actress is starring in a new series so I bought her the novel it’s based on, so she can read it before the show is released. My brother got her a Popmart figurine. \n\nWhen we went over to their house and her husband realized that he forgot, he got upset. He said we should have warned him since we know how much time he spends at work and that things can slip his mind.",
