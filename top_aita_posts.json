Sometimes I need to be working past midnight and can’t just leave the dorm because having multiple monitors and a keyboard helps me, especially since I’m a CS major. I told him to just get an eye mask if the light from two monitors (facing away from him) is that much of a problem, but he said even the sound of a keyboard (specifically designed to be quiet) would keep him up and wants me out of the room completely while he sleeps.
