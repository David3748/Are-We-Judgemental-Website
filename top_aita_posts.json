I told her if she wants another phone she can return it/sell it and pay the difference herself. Both parents are upset with me for not asking her or clearing it with them beforehand. \n\nAITA? I would think that’s a great upgrade but maybe I’m out of the loop for what the proper phone for a teenager is. ",
