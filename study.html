                    <h2><span class="section-icon">üìù</span> 1. The Setup / TL;DR</h2>
                    <p>We wanted to see if Computer Science students (specifically from CMSC320 sections) judge situations differently than the general Reddit r/AITA community. Students took a survey with modified AITA posts (rephrased as "Am I a Jerk?", sometimes with genders swapped). We compared their answers to the judgments found in the comments of the original Reddit posts.</p>
                    <p><em>Spoiler:</em> Initial thoughts suggested similarity, but the actual data showed significant differences.</p>

                    <h2><span class="section-icon">üî¨</span> 2. How We Did It (Data & Methods)</h2>
                    <p>We grabbed comments from 5 original r/AITA posts that matched the survey questions. We automatically sorted comments based on the standard AITA acronyms: "YTA" (You're The Asshole), "NTA" (Not The Asshole), "INFO" (Information Needed), "NAH" (No Assholes Here), and "ESH" (Everyone Sucks Here).</p>
                    <p>The student survey data used different labels: "Not a jerk", "Mildly a jerk", and "Strongly a jerk". To compare apples-to-apples(ish), we converted both sets of labels into three simple categories:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>YTA:</strong> You're The Asshole / Strongly a jerk</li>
                        <li><strong>Neither:</strong> ESH / INFO / NAH / Mildly a jerk</li>
                        <li><strong>NTA:</strong> Not The Asshole / Not a jerk</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Here's the conversion cheat sheet:</p>

                    <p>After sorting and standardizing, we ran Chi-Squared tests. The results were clear: there was a <strong>statistically significant difference</strong> in how the CMSC320 students judged the situations compared to the Redditors on AITA for <i>all five</i> posts tested.</p>
                    <p>Here's the raw data and the test results (low p-values mean the difference is unlikely due to chance):</p>

                         <p>This chart shows the ratio of YTA votes to NTA votes for each group and question. A higher bar means more "Asshole" judgments relative to "Not the Asshole" judgments.</p>

                         <p>Notice how the student ratio (Red bars) is lower in 4 out of 5 cases, suggesting they lean less towards the YTA judgment compared to Redditors (Blue bars).</p>

                        <h2><span class="section-icon">ü§î</span> 5. So, Are "We" Judgmental? (Conclusion)</h2>
                        <p>Okay, there are some caveats (confounders). The way data was collected was different (survey vs comments), the original posts were public while the survey was private, Prof. Morawski's paraphrasing might have changed things, and the "Mildly a jerk" option added nuance not present in AITA votes.</p>
                        <p>BUT, even with those points, the evidence strongly suggests a real difference between how CMSC320 students and Redditors judged these scenarios. Importantly, in 4 out of 5 cases, the students were *less* likely to label someone the "asshole" (relative to NTA) compared to Redditors.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> Based on this study, "we" (CMSC320 students) appear to be *less* judgmental than the r/AITA community, at least for these specific situations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Future Ideas:</strong> To get better data, future surveys could match the AITA questions more closely, or maybe even analyze actual comments from students given Reddit accounts (ethically tricky!).</p>
